Important:
When speaker is not connected bring input level to zero and set it back to previous level when is connected back. (Prefs in settings).

One or more segments of registered output is kept except when deleted (with undo the last one or with delete all) or overwritten. 

Always play the registered segments at their time

Check for noise when app is back from background (possible conflict with other apps?) or the speaker is plugged/unplugged/re-plugged.

Implement real UI.
